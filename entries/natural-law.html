            <h2>The Gut Feeling</h2>
            <p>Beyond any rules, laws, or religious texts, there's that "gut feeling" we all haveâ€”an inner sense of what feels right and what feels wrong. This, to me, is the essence of our moral conscience. It's the built-in compass that guides us, even when no one is looking.</p>
            
            <h3>The Extra Change</h3>
            <p>I had a simple experience with this recently. I bought a coffee and paid with a large bill. The barista was new and flustered, and accidentally gave me about ten euros too much in change. My first, fleeting thought was, "Wow, free money!" But it was immediately followed by a heavy, uncomfortable feeling in my stomach. It just felt wrong.</p>
            
            <p>There was no law forcing me to say anything, and no one would have known. But my own conscience wouldn't let it go. I pointed out the mistake, and the barista was incredibly relieved and thankful. The feeling of doing the right thing and the sense of inner peace that followed was worth far more than ten euros. It was a clear reminder that our internal compass, if we choose to listen to it, will always point us toward integrity.</p>
