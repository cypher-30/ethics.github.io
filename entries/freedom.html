            <p>This quote hits home, and I couldn’t agree more. Of late, I made the decision to stop drinking and going out. It was a choice that seemed difficult, especially considering the pressures from all around, with everyone on social media supposedly “living their best life.” It was a reflecting point for me: was I really living my best life?</p>
            
            <p>What is the "best life"? Is it spending time with friends but not remembering anything the next morning, too sick to even get up? That wasn’t for me. I tried it, and since stopping, I’ve never been better. There are better ways of spending a weekend, and it doesn’t have to be wasted.</p>

            <h3>The Pressure of Conformity</h3>
            <p>Yes, I still get requests to have a drink, "just this once," they say. And don’t get me started on the FOMO (fear of missing out) with Instagram captions like “Never been more alive and free.” This led me to delete my major social media accounts: Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat. I feel like these apps just contributed more to me conforming to trends in the name of “it’s what everyone is doing.”</p>
            
            <p>But beyond that, I don’t believe in the performative nature of it all. People are on their phones, taking pictures of what to post, but no one takes in the moment. You get stuck in a never-ending loop of trying to show people you attended this event or ate this meal, all for an audience that is likely doing the same.</p>

            <p>This is not a healthy way of living. Ever since deleting those apps, I’ve never been happier, more free from the shackles of impressing people. I’ve been more open to hobbies, reading, meditation, and writing. Even writing this journal feels like a natural part of my routine, and I love it. This is my version of freedom.</p>
